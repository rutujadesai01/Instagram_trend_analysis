# Insta Post Analysis Using ML for Trend Prediction

This project uses machine learning to analyze Instagram post data and predict engagement trends. By examining factors like captions, posting time, likes, comments, and reach, the model identifies patterns that influence content performance. It leverages a stacked regression approach combining XGBoost, Random Forest, and meta-models to provide accurate predictions with an average RÂ² score of 0.87.

The system is backed by Astra DB for data storage and includes an API for serving predictions. This tool is designed to help creators, marketers, and analysts optimize their Instagram content strategy based on data-driven insights.


## Features

-  Analyze post performance based on content and posting time
- Predict likes, comments, and reach using a stacked regression model
- Identify top-performing posts and engagement trends
- Discover the best times to post for maximum interaction
- Data stored and processed with Astra DB
